# EasyUtensils
Creating utensil designs using imagining and defining its appearance and function, modeling it in 3D software, converting it to data, rendering the data into a photo-realistic 3D image, testing the design, and refining as necessary.

# Utensil Design

This project outlines the process of creating utensil designs by turning data into a 3D image. The process involves imagining and defining the appearance and function of the utensil, modeling it in 3D software, converting it to data, rendering the data into a photo-realistic 3D image, testing the design, and refining as necessary.

## Prerequisites
- 3D modeling software (e.g. Blender, AutoCAD, SolidWorks)
- 3D rendering software (e.g. Keyshot, V-Ray)
- 3D printer (optional)

## Steps
1. Conceptualization: Imagine and define the appearance and function of the utensil.
2. Modeling: Use 3D modeling software to create a 3D model of the utensil based on the concept.
3. Data Generation: Convert the 3D model into numerical data.
4. Rendering: Use 3D rendering software to generate a photo-realistic 3D image of the utensil.
5. Testing: Test the design in virtual reality or physically print the design using a 3D printer to assess its functionality and ergonomics.
6. Refinement: Based on the results of the testing, refine the design as necessary.
